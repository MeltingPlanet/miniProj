# miniProj

This is a project that I have been working on during a week long workshop in a course called Audio Programming at Music Communication and Technology at NTNU. The result is a keyboard-controlled waveguide-synth, where you can chose among different instruments and add effects to these. This is a work in progress, and may contain some bugs :)
